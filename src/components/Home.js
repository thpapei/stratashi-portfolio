              I am a 27 year old visual artist based in
              Greece. I started editing animation in music 13 years ago and
              experimenting with VFX, animation and directing soon after I
              attended Ι.Ε.Κ. ΑΚΜΗ and took certificate 8 years ago. Since
              then  I have been working as an acrobat in a theater on
              the side while doing music video and editing jobs as my
              main job. My passion still goes strong while I am exploring
              art every day through many roads that make my grateful for
              the ride that we call life.
